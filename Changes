Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-DualLife

{{$NEXT}}
          - Makefile.PL is now processed at filemunging time, by inserting
            content into pre-processed template: this allows other plugins to
            see the full file content earlier, and properly respects the
            purpose of each dzil phase.
          - all modules in the distribution are now checked in
            Module::CoreList, as they may have different entered_core versions
            (e.g. autodie, Fatal)

          - use Module::Metadata to extract the package name of the main
            module, rather than deriving it from the distribution name
          - bump prereq on Module::CoreList, to ensure it is new enough to be
            aware of all relevant core releases
          - fix checks for module not being dual-lifed at all
          - configuration variables are now included in distribution metadata

          - do nothing if the version the module entered core is late enough
            that no special action is needed
          - calculate 'entered_core' parameter from Module::CoreList, rather
            than assuming 5.009005
          - build fails if module is not dual-life at all
